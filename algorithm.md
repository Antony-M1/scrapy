# Algorithm
When scraping a webpage efficiently, you need to consider several factors such as the structure of the website, the volume of data, and the rate at which you can make requests to the server. Here are some approaches and algorithms

<summary><h2>Crawl Delay and Politeness</h2></summary>
 
`Crawl Delay` and `Politeness` refer to strategies employed in web scraping to ensure that bots (web crawlers or spiders) behave in a respectful and considerate manner towards the websites they are accessing. These strategies are essential to prevent overloading servers with too many requests, which could lead to server strain, increased server costs, or even IP blocking by the website.

**Crawl Delay:**
* **Definition:** Crawl-delay is the `intentional pause` or `delay` between consecutive requests made by a web crawler to a server. It specifies the time a crawler should wait before making another request.
* **Purpose:**
  * **Resource Conservation:** Helps conserve server resources by spacing out requests over time.
  * **Avoiding Overload:** Prevents overloading the server, especially for websites with limited bandwidth or shared hosting.
* **Implementation:**
  * Webmasters may specify a crawl delay in the `robots.txt` file using the `Crawl-delay` directive. For example: Crawl-delay: 5 indicates a delay of `5 seconds` between requests.

**Politeness:**
* **Definition:** Politeness, in the context of web scraping, refers to adhering to ethical guidelines and showing respect to the website and its resources.
* **Respect robots.txt:** Follow the directives in the `robots.txt` file, which may include `crawl delay` and `other rules`.
  * **User-Agent:** Use a proper and descriptive `User-Agent` in `HTTP headers` to **identify** the web crawler. This helps websites understand the nature of the bot and may prevent blocking.
  * **Avoid Overloading:** Limit the number of requests to avoid overloading the server. This includes respecting any specified crawl delay.
  * **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to gracefully handle issues such as `timeouts`, `connection errors`, or unexpected changes in the `website's structure`.
