## Crawl Delay and Politeness
`Crawl Delay` and `Politeness` refer to strategies employed in web scraping to ensure that bots (web crawlers or spiders) behave in a respectful and considerate manner towards the websites they are accessing. These strategies are essential to prevent overloading servers with too many requests, which could lead to server strain, increased server costs, or even IP blocking by the website.

**Crawl Delay:**
* **Definition:** Crawl-delay is the `intentional pause` or `delay` between consecutive requests made by a web crawler to a server. It specifies the time a crawler should wait before making another request.
* **Purpose:**
  * **Resource Conservation:** Helps conserve server resources by spacing out requests over time.
  * **Avoiding Overload:** Prevents overloading the server, especially for websites with limited bandwidth or shared hosting.
