# items.py

Define here the models for your scraped items. [Documentation](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/items.html)

The main goal in scraping is to extract structured data from unstructured sources, typically, `web pages`. **Spiders** may return the extracted data as **items**, Python objects that define **key-value** pairs.

Scrapy supports multiple types of items. When you create an item, you may use whichever type of item you want. When you write code that receives an item, your code should work for any item type.
