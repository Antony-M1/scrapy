Here is the List of `Library`

<details>
  <summary><b><a href="https://pypi.org/project/attrs/">attrs</a></b></summary>
  
  attrs is the Python package that will bring back the `joy` of `writing classes` by relieving you from the drudgery of implementing object protocols (aka dunder methods). Trusted by `NASA` for Mars missions since 2020!

Its main goal is to help you to write concise and correct software without slowing down your code.

<details>
  <summary><b><a href="https://pypi.org/project/Automat/">Automat</a></b></summary>
  
 Automat is a library for concise, idiomatic Python expression of finite-state automata (particularly deterministic finite-state transducers).

  <summary><b><a href="https://pypi.org/project/certifi/">certifi</a></b></summary>
  
Certifi provides Mozilla’s carefully curated collection of Root Certificates for validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of TLS hosts. It has been extracted from the Requests project.

<details>
  <summary><b><a href="https://pypi.org/project/cffi/">cffi</a></b></summary>
  
`C` Foreign Function Interface for Python. Interact with almost any `C` code from Python, based on `C-like` declarations that you can often copy-paste from header files or documentation.

<details>
  <summary><b><a href="https://pypi.org/project/charset-normalizer/">charset-normalizer</a></b></summary>
  
A library that helps you read text from an `unknown charset` encoding.
Motivated by `chardet`, I'm trying to resolve the issue by taking a new approach. All `IANA` character set names for which the Python core library provides codecs are supported.

<details>
  <summary><b><a href="https://pypi.org/project/constantly/">constantly</a></b></summary>
  
A library that provides `symbolic` constant support. It includes collections and constants with text, numeric, and bit flag values. Originally `twisted.python.constants` from the `Twisted` project.

<details>
  <summary><b><a href="https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/">cryptography</a></b></summary>
  
`cryptography` is a package which provides cryptographic recipes and primitives to Python developers. Our goal is for it to be your “cryptographic standard library”. It supports Python 3.7+ and PyPy3 7.3.10+.

`cryptography` includes both high level recipes and low level interfaces to common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, message digests, and key derivation functions. For example, to encrypt something with `cryptography’s` high level symmetric encryption recipe:

<details>
  <summary><b><a href="https://pypi.org/project/cssselect/">cssselect</a></b></summary>
  
cssselect is a BSD-licensed Python library to parse CSS3 selectors and translate them to XPath 1.0 expressions.

XPath 1.0 expressions can be used in `lxml` or another `XPath` engine to find the matching elements in an `XML` or `HTML` document.

<details>
  <summary><b><a href="https://pypi.org/project/filelock/">filelock</a></b></summary>
  
This package contains a single module, which implements a platform independent file lock in Python, which provides a simple way of inter-process communication. [Official Document](https://py-filelock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b><a href="https://pypi.org/project/hyperlink/">hyperlink</a></b></summary>
  
The humble, but powerful, URL runs everything around us. Chances are you’ve used several just to read this text.

Hyperlink is a featureful, pure-Python implementation of the URL, with an emphasis on correctness. MIT licensed.

See the docs at http://hyperlink.readthedocs.io.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b><a href="https://pypi.org/project/idna/">idna</a></b></summary>
  

Support for the Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) protocol as specified in `RFC 5891`. This is the latest version of the protocol and is sometimes referred to as `IDNA 2008`.

This library also provides support for `Unicode Technical Standard 46`, Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing.

This acts as a suitable replacement for the `encodings.idna` module that comes with the Python standard library, but which only supports the older superseded IDNA specification (RFC 3490).
