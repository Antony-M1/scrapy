<details>
  <summary><b><a href="https://pypi.org/project/itemloaders/">itemloaders</a></b></summary>

`itemloaders` is a library that helps you collect data from `HTML`and `XML` sources.

It comes in handy to extract data from web pages, as it supports data extraction using `CSS` and `XPath` Selectors.

It’s specially useful when you need to standardize the data from many sources. For example, it allows you to have all your casting and parsing rules in a single place.

</details>


<details>
  <summary><b><a href="https://pypi.org/project/packaging/">packaging</a></b></summary>

This library provides utilities that implement the interoperability specifications which have clearly one correct behaviour (eg: PEP 440) or benefit greatly from having a single shared implementation (eg: PEP 425).
</details>


<details>
  <summary><b><a href="https://pypi.org/project/parsel/">parsel</a></b></summary>

Parsel is a BSD-licensed Python library to extract data from HTML, JSON, and XML documents.

<details>
  <summary><b><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyasn1-modules/">pyasn1-modules</a></b></summary>

The pyasn1-modules package contains a collection of `ASN.1` data structures expressed as Python classes based on `pyasn1` data model.

If `ASN.1` module you need is not present in this collection, try using `Asn1ate` tool that compiles `ASN.1` documents into `pyasn1` code.

The project aims to include various enhancements to the recipe developed during use in various applications. It is primarily maintained by Mike Fletcher. A derivative of the project provides the `Django` web framework's **signal** system.
